# VotingCRUD - Rest Assured

Because of the nature of these tests (tests to an API), the API need to be running for this project to work.

While in the month of September, 2024, the deploy will be up and can be test it.

After this period, it will be needed to run it locally trough Docker containerization.

The API can be found [here](https://github.com/AurorinhaBoreal/VotingCRUD-BackEnd).
